  <p><mark>Calcium</mark> is the king of elements, it is
        needed more than any other element by weight and volume. The activities of the decay
        organisms (bacteria, fungi &amp; earthworms) are dependent upon the availability of
        calcium. It is the <mark>foundation of all biological systems</mark>, a
        component that gives the living cell it's capacitor characteristic via it's
        place in the cell membrane. Calcium is nature's prime detoxifier, without its
        availability there is degeneration, restricted cell communication and ultimately
        disease. </p>
<p><mark>Phosphate</mark> is the major catalyst in all living
  systems. It is necessary for <mark>photosynthesis and metaboism</mark>. The key
  to phosphate availability is in soil microorganism
  activity. Coloidal clay phosphate is prefered for long-term
  sustainable soil management. Soft rock phosphate does not tie up
  readily into insoluble tricalcium phosphate as do the acid
  phosphates. As phosphates become more availbale there will be less
  leaching of nutrients, less erosion and weed pressure.</p>

<p><mark>Potash</mark> determines the <mark>thickness of the stalk
  and leaves, the size of fruit that set</mark>, and is used in large
  quantities by plants, readily adsorbed on colloids. </p>

<p><mark>Nitrogen</mark> is the major electrolyte in the soil. Every
  cell contains nitrogen, a part of all amino acids, chlorophyll and
  enzymes, it is the sun in every cell. Nitrogen acts as an "isotope"
  alternating btween the nitrate form and the ammonium form. Nitrate
  nitrogen primarily promote <mark>growth responses</mark> in plants, wheras
  ammonical nitrogen promote <mark>fruiting responses</mark>. The intake of
  ammonical nitrogen into plants is directly proportional to the
  <mark>density of desirable root rhizophere microorganisms</mark>. These
  microorganisms fare very poorly with herbicides, fungisides and soil
  insecticides. Nitrogen is one of the mos oveused materials in modern
  soil maintainence, also one of the most polluting.</p>
  
<p><mark>Carbon</mark> is the element that conveys life into the
        system. All living systems must have carbon. It is the energy storehouse and the governor
        of moisture. Carbon provides <mark>nutrient holding capacities</mark> that
        buffer the soil and retain calcium. One biocarbon holds four parts water. It acts as a
        deodorizer and filter of the air and water.</p>

<p><mark>Copper</mark> is the key to <mark>elasticity</mark>
        in the plant, an important nutrient for many microbes, it interacts with iron and
        manganese and <mark>regulates mold</mark>.</p>

<p>Trace amounts of <mark>Cobalt</mark> are necessary for nitrogen
        fixation &amp; synthesis of vitamin B12, necessary in ruminants, <mark>essential
        for bark, cellulose, root nodulation and seedcoat formation</mark>. It works in
        conjunction with molybdenum &amp; fluoride for <br>
        plant sturdiness. </p>

<p><mark>Silica</mark> is an important part of cell walls in
        grasses.Water diatoms need Silica to proliferate. Its piezoelectric characteristics
        enable it to <mark>refract light and resonate with lightening</mark>. The
        combined atomic weight of silica and carbon are equal to calcium. This correlates to the
        calcium interaction in the plant through transmutation in the cells. </p>

<p><mark>Sulphur</mark> feeds beneficial microbes, is found in B
        vitamins. It is essential for certain amino acids to <mark>complete
        proteins and chelate heavy metals</mark>. Tissue, hair, tendons and ligaments all require
        Sulphur.</p>

<p><mark>Iron</mark> is necessary for the maintenance &amp;
        synthesis of <mark>chlorophyll and oxygen</mark>. RNA metabolism in the
        chloroblasts activates enzymes and draws infrared heat from the Sun promoting thickness in
        leaves. Water vapor oxidizes off iron to provide ammonia. It is released slowly, not
        offensive, yet still available for the plant.</p>

<p><mark>Boron</mark> is important for filling hollow stems, it is
        an <mark>enzyme activator</mark> and has biocide properties that avoid
        blackheart when utilized with calcium.</p>

<p><mark>Zinc</mark><mark> is a component in over 80 enzymes,</mark>prevents blight, root rotting and allows dead wood to shed from trees. Zinc compliments
        the manufacture of acetic acid.</p>
      
<p><mark>Molybdenum </mark>is <mark>particularly
        essential for enzymes</mark> nitrogenase and nitrate reductase to fix atmospheric nitrogen
        into NH3 in the plant. It assists the integrity of bark or skin and is essential for
        phosphorous and ascorbic acid metabolism.</p>
