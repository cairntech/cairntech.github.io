  <p><mark>Calcium</mark> is the king of elements, it is
        needed more than any other element by weight and volume. The activities of the decay
        organisms (bacteria, fungi &amp; earthworms) are dependent upon the availability of
        calcium. It is the <mark>foundation of all biological systems</mark>, a
        component that gives the living cell it's capacitor characteristic vi a it's
        place in the cell membrane. Calcium is nature's prime detoxifier, without its
        availability there is degeneration, restricted cell communication and ultimately
        disease. </p>

<p><mark>Carbon</mark> is the element that conveys life into the
        system. All living systems must have carbon. It is the energy storehouse and the governor
        of moisture. Carbon provides <mark>nutrient holding capacities</mark> that
        buffer the soil and retain calcium. One biocarbon holds four parts water. It acts as a
        deodorizer and filter of the air and water.</p>

<p><mark>Copper</mark> is the key to <mark>elasticity</mark>
        in the plant, an important nutrient for many microbes, it interacts with iron and
        manganese and <mark>regulates mold</mark>.</p>
        <p>Trace amounts of <mark>Cobalt</mark> are necessary for nitrogen
        fixation &amp; synthesis of vitamin B12, necessary in ruminants, <mark>essential
        for bark, cellulose, root nodulation and seedcoat formation</mark>. It works in
        conjunction with molybdenum &amp; fluoride for <br>
        plant sturdiness. </p>

<p><mark>Silica</mark> is an important part of cell walls in
        grasses.Water diatoms need Silica to proliferate. Its piezoelectric characteristics
        enable it to <mark>refract light and resonate with lightening</mark>. The
        combined atomic weight of silica and carbon are equal to calcium. This correlates to the
        calcium interaction in the plant through transmutation in the cells. </p>

<p><mark>Sulphur</mark> feeds beneficial microbes, is found in B
        vitamins. It is essential for certain amino acids to <mark>complete
        proteins and chelate heavy metals</mark>. Tissue, hair, tendons and ligaments all require
        Sulphur.</p>

<p><mark>Iron</mark> is necessary for the maintenance &amp;
        synthesis of <mark>chlorophyll and oxygen</mark>. RNA metabolism in the
        chloroblasts activates enzymes and draws infrared heat from the Sun promoting thickness in
        leaves. Water vapor oxidizes off iron to provide ammonia. It is released slowly, not
        offensive, yet still available for the plant.</p>

<p><mark>Boron</mark> is important for filling hollow stems, it is
        an <mark>enzyme activator</mark> and has biocide properties that avoid
        blackheart when utilized with calcium.</p>

<p><mark>Zinc</mark><mark> is a component in over 80 enzymes,</mark>prevents blight, root rotting and allows dead wood to shed from trees. Zinc compliments
        the manufacture of acetic acid.</p>
      
<p><mark>Molybdenum </mark>is <mark>particularly
        essential for enzymes</mark> nitrogenase and nitrate reductase to fix atmospheric nitrogen
        into NH3 in the plant. It assists the integrity of bark or skin and is essential for
        phosphorous and ascorbic acid metabolism.</p>
