    increase fertility and growth. It is carefully selected, tested, extracted and crushed
    from rare deposits in the Canadian Shield. It has over 70 essential minerals and trace
    elements required for healthy, strong crops. Greenstone is highly paramagnetic and has
    qualities that attract and repel soil particles which increase flocculation and
    respiration. This improves tilth and porosity of your soil and stimulates growth. Using
    Greenstone is a tried and tested way of creating ideal diverse soil conditions for quality
    yields. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000305054311fw_/http://www.cairntech.com/garden.htm"><font color="#0000FF"><u>Apply</u></font></a> anytime,

    silica, trace manganese, zinc and an assortment of trace elements. It works by enhancing
    the natural breakdown process which stabilizes the usable nutrients and elements. Adding
    Gypsum+ to manure reduces odors by locking up ammonia, turning carbonate of ammonia into
    odorless insoluble ammonium sulphate, which prevents leaching. Composting manure with
    Gypsum+ increases organic matter of static piles and fertility of lagoons. It also
    detoxifies chemical residuals in contaminated soil. Gypsum+ is an essential component for
    methionine production and other sulphur based amino acids such as taurine and cysteine.
    These aminos chelate lead and aluminum. Gypsum+ regulates potassium, magnesium and iron
    ratios. Control phosphorous and transform it into insoluble calcium hydroxysulphate with
    Gypsum+. Manage your soil pH with Gypsum+ and promote your nutrient availability the
    natural way. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000305054311fw_/http://www.cairntech.com/garden.htm"><font color="#0000FF"><u>Apply</u></font></a> to land
