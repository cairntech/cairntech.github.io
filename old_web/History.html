    <td><img src="./History_files/History.GIF" width="320" height="60"><p>Using minerals to rejuvenate
    soil is not a new idea. For thousands of years, in ancient cultures, silt was taken from
    the bottom of rivers and used as fertilizer to cultivate crops and this practice is still
    used in some regions today. However many lakes and rivers are now tainted with pollutants
    and dredging what is left of the eco system is destructive and hazardous to our water
    supply.</p>
    <p align="left">.<img src="./History_files/mush1.JPG" width="225" height="144"><br>
    <font face="Arial"><small>Mushrooms flourish on decomposing wood which has</small><br>
    <small>been treated with minerals in the Cairn Tech research </small><br>
    <small>and development forest. </small></font></p>
    <p>In nature, fertile soil is created by the breakdown of large sections of minerals,
    trace elements and the accumulation of organic matter, humates, air, water and an
    abundance of micro organisms. The practice of crushing minerals and using them to enrich
    soil was discovered in the 1800’s by Dr. Julius Hensel. Hensel had accidentally
    crushed some pieces of granite while milling some grain. He threw the pulverized powder
    into his garden and was surprised to see how vigorously the plants grew. He later repeated
    the experiment and broadcast crushed minerals around some withering apple trees. To his
    amazement the trees responded remarkably and bore impressive fruit. Prior to the
    mineralization the trees had wormy imperfect fruit. Hensel continued using pulverized
    minerals with consistent success. Word soon spread and there was a demand for these
    crushed minerals.</p>
    <p>During this time there was also a chemist named Liebig who had other ideas. His belief
    was that plants require only 3 nutrients, Nitrogen, Phosphorous and Potassium, NPK. His
    theories were soon accepted by companies looking for quick fix solutions and high profits.
    With more aggressive marketing techniques the public was soon swayed to believe
    Liebig’s NPK approach. Although Liebig’s later realized he was wrong and
    recanted before he died, "When a chemist makes mistakes in rating agricultural
    fertilizers, don’t be too critical of his errors, because he has had to base his
    conclusions on facts which he can’t know from his own experience. After I learned the
    reason why my fertilizers weren’t effective in the proper way, I was like like a
    person that received a new life. For along with that, all process of tillage were now
    explained as to their natural laws. Now that this principal is known and clear to all
    eyes, the only thing that remains is the astonishment of why it hadn’t been
    discovered a long time ago. The human spirit, however, is a strange thing: whatever
    doesn’t fit into the given circle of thinking, doesn’t exist." Ironically,
    Liebig’s theories are still accepted today.</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="./History_files/andesite.GIF" width="168" height="168"><br>
    <font face="Arial"><small>Cairn Tech Minerals generate superior quality produce<br>
    and more abundant yields.</small></font></p>
    <p>The use of minerals and "micro nutrients" as they are often referred to, is
    now becoming more popular as we are confronted with extreme harsh weather and poor quality
    produce. Organic farming alone often does not address the issue of mineralization.
    Minerals need to be replenished in depleted soil.</p>
    <p>However, not all minerals are created equal. Some deposits are much more potent and
    effective than others. Geological processes can effect the formation, quality and
    fertility of mineral deposits. Alan Reed, founder and President of Cairn Tech, has
    discovered extremely rare deposits, which when tested were found to contain highly fertile
    minerals and trace elements. Alan has formulated these minerals into blends which are
    ideal for growing purposes. Cairn Tech has researched the use of our mineral products
    extensively for over 10 years and is confident with the overwhelming results. Our research
    has indicated using minerals and trace elements is extremely beneficial for successful
    cultivation. This can be done several ways: adding minerals directly to the soil, adding
    minerals to compost (this method is quite effective as nitrogen is locked in and leaching
    avoided), and by adding minerals as a feed additive, which promotes healthy livestock and
    increase the fertility of manure. We use only rare, high quality minerals, selected,
    extracted and blended for ultimate performance.</p>
