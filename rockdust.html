            <h3 id = "Greenstone">Greenstone</h3>
            <p>A unique, natural volcanic, metamorphic blend created
    to enrich soil and increase fertility and growth. It is carefully
    selected, tested, extracted and crushed from rare deposits in the
    Canadian Shield. It has over 70 essential minerals and trace
    elements required for healthy, strong crops. Greenstone is highly
    paramagnetic and has qualities that attract and repel soil
    particles which increase flocculation and respiration. This
    improves tilth and porosity of your soil and stimulates
    growth. Using Greenstone is a tried and tested way of creating
    ideal diverse soil conditions for quality yields. Apply anytime,
    200-1000 lb per acre, or 40 lb per 1,000 sq. ft. For orchards

	    <h3 id = "Gypsum">Gypsum+</h3>
	    <p>A Calcium Sulphate Blend for Composting, Gardens,
    Flowers, Ginseng, and Trees of all species. Remedy Salt Damaged
    Walkways, Boulevards, Lawns and Contaminated Soil. Contains 76%
    pure calcium carbonate (with 20% available calcium), 15% sulphur,
    6% silica, trace manganese, zinc and an assortment of trace
    elements. It works by enhancing the natural breakdown process
    which stabilizes the usable nutrients and elements. Adding Gypsum+
    to manure reduces odors by locking up ammonia, turning carbonate
    of ammonia into odorless insoluble ammonium sulphate, which
    prevents leaching. Composting manure with Gypsum+ increases
    organic matter of static piles and fertility of lagoons. It also
    detoxifies chemical residuals in contaminated soil. Gypsum+ is an
    essential component for methionine production and other sulphur
    based amino acids such as taurine and cysteine.  These aminos
    chelate lead and aluminum. Gypsum+ regulates potassium, magnesium
    and iron ratios. Control phosphorous and transform it into
    insoluble calcium hydroxysulphate with Gypsum+. Manage your soil
    pH with Gypsum+ and promote your nutrient availability the natural
    way.  Apply to land early spring and fall 200-2000 lb per acre, or
    200 lb (1:10 ratio) per ton of stockpile manure or to control
    odors in barns sprinkle at a 1:4 ratio, avoid gumming in compost
    piles 1:6 ratio. For lawns or gardens and golf courses, 35 lb per
